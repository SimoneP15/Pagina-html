    <h1>Emily Robertson</h1>  
    <h4>There is an inherent joy in the sweet, ink and water colour work of Glasgow School of Art graduate, Emily Robertson. Mix that with her impressive ability to capture the smallest of details with the slightest flicks of her brush and you’ve got someone who can capture a mood, a style and the true character of her subject with a signature flair.
        From juicy pastries and cosmetics to maps and stylish portraits of butchers, Emily’s eye for colour and texture is remarkable, and very popular among her clients, including: Anthropologie, Chanel, Faber&Faber, Marks and Spencer, National Trust, Pentagram NY and Port magazine.
        From worldwide political commentary to doodling on windows, walls, tables and objects around him, Jean's work is instantly recognisable, inimitable and holds a purity that only truly can be borne from true passion for his craft.
        Accompanying Jean's effortless, humorous style, is his incredible dedication. He juggles countless commissions, exhibitions and mediums simultaneously, driven by an undiminished need to communicate.</h4>
